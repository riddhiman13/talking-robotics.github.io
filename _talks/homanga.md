## Abstract
Transferring control policies to different environments with minimal fine-tuning is an important challenge in robotics. It is important to learn high-performing policies that can adapt to dynamics variations in the environment, for achieving sample efficient learning, and in ensuring safety of the robot and the environment. In this talk, I will describe the problem of transferring policies across multiple environments with different dynamics parameters and motor noise variations, and introduce a framework that decouples the processes of policy learning and system identification. The approach is called MANGA: Method Agnostic Neural-policy Generalization and Adaptation, whose key idea is training dynamics conditioned policies and efficiently learning to estimate the dynamics parameters of the environment given off-policy state-transition rollouts. I'll also discuss how some other recent papers have approached this problem, and why it is important to learn policies that are adaptive instead of being robust.
