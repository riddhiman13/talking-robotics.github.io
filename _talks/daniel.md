## Speaker

Daniel Rakita is a Ph.D. student of computer science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison advised by Michael Gleicher and Bilge Mutlu.  He received a Bachelors of Music Performance from the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music in 2012. His research lies at the intersection of motion planning, trajectory optimization, shared-control, and human-robot interaction, and commonly involves creating motion optimization approaches that allow robot manipulators to move smoothly and accurately in real-time.

## Abstract
In order to complete tasks, robots need to consistently calculate joint-space trajectories such that their end-effectors pass through the correct position, with the correct orientation, at the correct time.  In many cases, these trajectories must not only be accurate, i.e., avoiding large end-effector translation or orientation errors; and feasible, i.e., avoiding self-collisions, joint-space discontinuities, or kinematic singularities; but they must also be calculated quickly to afford robots the ability to act and react in uncertain or dynamic environments.  In this talk, I will overview technical methods we have developed that attempt to achieve such feasible, accurate, and time-sensitive robot-arm motions.  In particular, I will detail our inverse kinematics solver called RelaxedIK that utilizes both non-linear optimization and machine learning to achieve a smooth, feasible, and accurate end-effector to joint-space mapping on-the-fly.  I will highlight numerous ways we have applied our technical methods to real-world-inspired problems, such as mapping human-arm-motion to robot-arm-motion in real-time to afford effective shared-control interfaces and automatically moving a camera-in-hand robot in a remote setting to optimize a viewpoint for a teleoperator.  I will conclude with a preview of our ongoing and future work in this space.
