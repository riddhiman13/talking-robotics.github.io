## Abstract
The talk introduces and contextualizes Nikhita's experience with robots. Nikhita shares her experience seeing how robotics problems look so different when you transition from academia to industry. She discusses about starting [Artificial](https://www.artificial.com/) and doing 200+ user interviews to find a valuable use case for robotics in the field. 
To conclude, she focuses on [Artificial](https://www.artificial.com/) and the challenge of robotics and automation in dynamic, unstructured environments like the scientific lab.
